# About the App
A timer designed for workout enthusiast
This Workout Timer is designed for workout enthusiasts. 
And the idea of making it is from my own experience. 

Sometimes, a set of workouts, every rep is supposed to be timed. 
For instance, a set of core exercises normally is 
5min full sit up, 
5min mountain claimer, 
5min high plank etc. 

Then I felt I needed an app that could set multiple timers at once, 
and I couldnâ€™t find any on both iOS and Android platforms.

Now I have one:)
